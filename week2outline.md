### Novel theory
Watt (*Rise of the Novel*, 1957), Lukacs (*Theory of the Novel*, 1914), McKeon

1.  Build a definition of formal realism and the novel using Watt and Lukacs/McKeon. “...the novel seeks, by giving form, to uncover and construct the concealed totality of life” (Lukacs, 189). Explain the relationship between the general/particular and the role of distance in the epic vs. the novel. What is the “concealed totality” in Trollope, and how does distance affect how the novel approaches it?

2. > An estrangement from an estrangement, second nature ‘is only a projection of man’s experience of his self-made environment as a prison instead of as a parental home.’ More characteristically,  th	e world of the novel is one not of imprisonment but of ‘transcendental homelessness.’ (McKeon, 179)

What does it mean for characters to experience this estrangement from their own constructed homes, and how does it relate to the social milieu they exist in?

3. > The novel’s mode of imitating reality may therefore be equally well summarised in terms of the procedures of another group of specialists in epistemology, the jury in a court of law. (Watt, 31)

How does Trollope play with this formal idea as his novel “assumes form as a result of the abstraction seeing through itself” (Lukacs, 195)?

### Realism and Verisimilitude

Barthes ("The Reality Effect,"" 1968), Jameson ("The Realist Floor Plan," 1985)

1. Summarize Barthes and Jameson’s arguments on the purpose of detail/description (Barthes’ “referential illusion” vs. Jameson’s “referent”).

2. >...we may go even further in our account of the ideological mission of the nineteenth century realistic novelists, and assert that their function is...to produce this whole new spatial and temporal configuration itself: what will come to be called ‘daily life’, the Alltag, or, in a different terminology, the ‘referent’ (Jameson, 374).

Where do we see these configurations in Trollope?

3. > The artists also are to be seen as ideologues but not in the narrow and debunking sense of the producers of false consciousness… What is at stake in their cultural production is therefore the retraining, the collective re-education, of a whole population whose mentalities and habits were formed in the previous mode of production, feudalism or the ancien regime. (Jameson, 374)

 What events or forces do you see marking this process of “re-education” in Trollope?

### Surveillance, Ideological Technologies

Foucault (*Discipline and Punish*, 1975), Miller (*The Novel and the Police*, 1988), Zuboff (*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*, 2018)

1. Summary of Foucault and Miller (Nicole)
2. How is surveillance/spectacle present in Trollope? How do news, gossip, and social networks function as or facilitate political/ideological technologies in Trollope? If “power produces knowledge” (Foucault, 27), what knowledge is produced in Trollope and by what power? How is that power visible or invisible, concentrated or diffuse?
3. Brief explanation of Althusser, ideological state apparatuses
4. Maya seminar paper:
	+ Mrs. Proudie and the church are not the only conveyors of Mr. Crawley’s punishment. Besides providing drama and spectacle, gossip also plays a major role in the novel as a political technology and apparatus.Mrs. Proudie and the church are not the only conveyors of Mr. Crawley’s punishment. Besides providing drama and spectacle, gossip also plays a major role in the novel as a political technology and apparatus.
	+ How does Mr. Crawley’s apparent pleasure and pride in his own self-degradation supports and/or defies the reproductive nature of state apparatuses?
5. Where is there a police presence in Trollope? How does this presence work to conceal itself? Ex: 106; Mr. Crawley’s refusal of self-surveillance
6.
Bringing in Zuboff:

			> Surveillance capitalism operates through unprecedented assymetries in knowledge and the power that accuse to knowledge. Surveillance capitalists know everything *about* us, whereas their operation are designed to be unknowable *to us*. They accumulate vast domains of new knowledge *from us*, but not *for us*. They predict our futures for the sake of others' gain, not ours. As long as surveillance capitalism and its behavioral futures markets are allowed to thrive, ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the twenty-first century.

> A first challenge to comprehension is the confusion between surveillance capitalism and the technologies it employs. Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a logic that imbues technology and commands it into action. Surveillance capitalism is a market form that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, but it is not the same as "the digital."

Note the Edison/Ford late 19th c moment that provides an analog to Zuboff's setting

> Chapter 2 explores the social conditions that summoned the digital into our everyday lives and enabled surveillance capitalism to root and flourish. I describe the "collision" between the centuries-old historical processes of individualization that shape our experience as self-determining individuals and the harsh social habitat produced by a decades-old regime of neoliberal market economics in which our sense of self-worth and needs for self-determination are routinely thwarted. The pain and frustration of this contradiction are the condition that sent us careening toward the internet for sustenance and ultimately bent us to surveillance capitalism's draconian quid pro quo.

With Zuboff in mind, what would/does literary realism look like under neoliberal hegemony? How would a “behavioral futures market” complicate or not complicate it? How might the colonialist history of surveillance problematize the form or lend it revolutionary potential?

The cheque: 621-22; 682

The ending: 727-8


Tying it all together:
“Thus the novel, by transforming itself into a normative being of becoming, surmounts itself” (Lukacs, 196). How is The Last Chronicle of Barset in “the process of becoming?” regarding punishment and normative social order? Discuss the interplay of ethics/justice and aesthetics in Trollope (Lukacs pg. 195, McKeon pg. 181, Foucault and Miller).
